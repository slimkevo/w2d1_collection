Postman Collection: Sample API Request

This Postman collection demonstrates a simple POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API, which is commonly used for testing and prototyping APIs. The collection includes one request that sends JSON data to create a new post.


This Postman collection is designed to help you understand how to make a POST request with JSON data to an API. It uses the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts endpoint, a free online REST API that provides placeholder data for testing.
